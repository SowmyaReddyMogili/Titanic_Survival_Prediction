# Titanic Survival Prediction & Passenger Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Titanic disaster dataset** to:
1. **Predict passenger survival** using machine learning (Logistic Regression).
2. **Cluster passengers** into distinct groups using K-Means based on demographic and travel attributes.

The dataset comes from the famous **Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** challenge. The project demonstrates **data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), supervised learning, and unsupervised learning**.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning** and handle missing values.
- Explore survival trends based on features like gender, age, class, and fare.
- Build a **Logistic Regression model** to predict survival chances.
- Apply **K-Means clustering** to segment passengers.
- Visualize results with clear and insightful charts.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for ML models and clustering


## 🔍 Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Inspection** – Understand dataset structure and basic statistics.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Generate plots to uncover survival patterns.
4. **Feature Engineering** – Create new variables (e.g., family size).
5. **Model Training** – Train Logistic Regression and evaluate performance.
6. **Passenger Clustering** – Use K-Means to group passengers based on features.
7. **Results & Visualization** – Compare model predictions and cluster insights.


## 📊 Results
- Logistic Regression model achieved **~80% accuracy** on test data.
- Clustering revealed **distinct passenger groups** based on demographics and ticket information.
- EDA confirmed that **women and children had higher survival rates**.
